## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project is a custom **Virtual Machine (VM)** with its own **assembly language** and **instruction set architecture (ISA)**. It includes:

- A custom instruction set (like MOVE, ADD, SHOW, etc.)
- An **Assembler** that translates assembly code into machine code (both text and binary)
- A **Virtual CPU (Interpreter)** that reads machine code and simulates execution
- Support for basic operations like:
  - Arithmetic (`ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, `DIV`)
  - Bitwise logic (`AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`)
  - Memory operations (`PUSH`, `POP`, `LOAD`)
  - Control flow (`START`, `LOOP`, `BR`, `HALT`)
  - Output (`SHOW`)
